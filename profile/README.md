# Arctic Metrics for Earth System Modeling at High Latitudes
A collection of Python/Matlab/R packages for the evaluation of Arctic climate processes in the HiLAT-RASM project.

## Overview
Arctic Metrics packages, comprehensive tools for assessing Arctic climate processes, are a key component of the HiLAT-RASM Capability Area I to improve our understanding of Arctic climate dynamics and evaluate modeling capabilities in Earth System Models.

## HiLAT-RASM Phase III 
The research project "HiLAT-RASM" aims to answer Arctic and Antarctic climate change questions through targeted application of global modeling and analysis capabilities to evolving polar processes and their impacts. This project is a collaboration between scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Naval Postgraduate School. The project also benefits from the expertise of academic collaborators from the University of Washington, University of Colorado at Boulder, Indiana University Bloomington, Pennsylvania State University, and University of Alaska Fairbanks.

## Funding
HiLAT-RASM is funded by the DOE Office of Science Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) program area.
